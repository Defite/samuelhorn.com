## Wow, nice to finally be up and running again

<p class="intro">So, after a couple of months without writing on wpahead.com Im finally ready with my new site.</p>

When i started wpahead about a year ago, I did it because I felt I had so much knowledge to share. I've been working as a web developer for the last ten or so years, and I wanted to give back to the community.

It took me about 5 posts to realise how sick I was about WordPress, and I soon realised that to keep the intrest up enough to spend hours on writing, I need to write about something that really exites me.

So i decided to ditch WordPress, which I know almost everything about, and start focusing on new stuff instead. That way i could both educate and learn at the same time.

### Jamstack & front-end focus

This time, I will write about my two favourite topics which are both very related - front-end development & design.

```css
& img {
  @apply object-cover my-8;
}

& h2 {
  @apply text-xl leading-xl mb-8 mt-12 font-semibold;
}
```

My interest for the JAM-stack, SSGs and microservices has really kicked of in the last couple of years, and I'm now at a point where i feel comfortable to talk about it.

So, what better way to start this of than building a new site.
